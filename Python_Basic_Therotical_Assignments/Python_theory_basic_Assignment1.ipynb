    "Expression: An expression is a combination of operators, constants and variables. An expression may consist of one or more operands, and zero or more operators to produce a value.  EX:- a+b\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 7 Types of Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Constant expressions: Constant Expressions consists of only constant values. A constant value is one that doesnâ€™t change.\n",
    "Examples:  10 + 5 / 6.0,\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Integral expressions: Integral Expressions are those which produce integer results after implementing all the automatic and explicit type conversions.       Examples: x, x * y, x + int( 5.0)\n",
    "where x and y are integer variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Floating expressions: Float Expressions are which produce floating point results after implementing all the automatic and explicit type conversions.         Examples: x + y, 10.75\n",
    "where x and y are floating point variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Relational expressions: Relational Expressions yield results of type bool which takes a value true or false. When arithmetic expressions are used on either side of a relational operator, they will be evaluated first and then the results compared. Relational expressions are also known as Boolean expressions.\n",
    "                                   Examples: x <= y, x + y > 2\n",
    "5)Logical expressions: Logical Expressions combine two or more relational expressions and produces bool type results.\n",
    "                                    Examples: x > y && x == 10, x == 10 || y == 5 \n",
    "6)Pointer expressions: Pointer Expressions produce address values.\n",
    "                                    Examples: &x, ptr, ptr++\n",
    "where x is a variable and ptr is a pointer.\n",

    "7)Bitwise expressions: Bitwise Expressions are used to manipulate data at bit level. They are basically used for testing or shifting bits.\n",
